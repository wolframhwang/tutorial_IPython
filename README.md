Quck tutorial for setting up development environment for IPython


# What is IPython?
For easier  and interactive development of Python codes, we use IPython in the Jupyter Notebook.

Some useful features include:
* A notebook (*.ipynb) contains python code as weel as some comments.
* You can launch your notebook from (any) web brower on your local machine while real computing is performed on a remote server.
* You can run block-by-block!This is very useful for debugging.

For more detail information, see the official website: [https://ipython.org](https://ipython.org)


# How to install?
The easest way to install Ipython is to use pip as follows.
```
pip install ipython
```


# How to use it?
You have two options to run and edit Ipython notebooks.

### on local machine

### launch remotely on a server 
The only difference from the local-launch is that you use SSH turnelling.
