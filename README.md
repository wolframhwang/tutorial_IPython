# What is IPython?
For more interactive development of Python codes, we use IPython in the Jupyter Notebook.
Some useful features include
* A notebook (*.ipynb) contains python code as weel as some comments.
* You can launch your notebook from (any) web brower on your local machine while real computing is performed on a remote server.
* You can run block-by-block!This is very useful for debugging.
